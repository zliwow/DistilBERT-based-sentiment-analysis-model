"Hey All This is my first post here. Been a regular over at the sub SPACs. You guys should definitely come over. Some good DD on SPACs which end up merging with some exciting companies, such as EV/renewable energy companies, and doubling in a day on occasion, all with very minimal downside risk. I've known about this sub for a while, but I've decided to write my first post after what happened to GME which is all over the place. That is the craziest shit I've ever seen, you guys are nuts! Congrats to all those who printed alot of tendies. On to our topic for the day. First off, for those of you autists (yeah I speak the language) who do not know, a SPAC is a shell company with no operations and which raises money through IPO. It then looks for a company it decides to merge with. If both sides can strike a deal, the money raised through the SPAC is given to the target company in exchange for part ownership in that company, meaning the holders of the SPAC's shares become shareholders of the acquired company once the deal goes through. Simple enough. Now I believe there is a good chance that Vy Global Growth, a SPAC that IPO'd late September 2020, is likely to eventually merge with Reddit, thereby turning VYGG's shares into shares of Reddit. Of course this is not a sure thing (nothing is when it comes to markets), but the below reasons lend support to this likely outcome: 1- Reddit CEO Steve Huffman: The Company will consider going public in the future. Source: https://www.businessinsider.com/reddit-is-reportedly-considering-an-ipo-2017-11 2- Guess who's one of the directors in Vy Global Growth. From VYGG's prospectus: "" Steve Huffman will serve as one of our directors following the completion of this offering. Mr. Huffman is the Co-Founder, Director and CEO of Reddit, the ‚Äúfront page of the internet‚Äù and the sixth most visited site in the U.S."" 3- SPAC sponsors generally provide an indication as to the industries they are targeting. From the prospectus: ""We are a newly formed blank check company that intends to partner with a technology business that will benefit from our global expertise to define the future of its industry."" 4- Vy Global Growth indicates that it prefers ""Founder-led companies"" (sound familar?). From the prospectus: "" We look for businesses that are founder-led with a long-term vision."" Reddit is of course founded and currently led by none other than our Steve Huffman. 5- Link between VY Capital and Reddit: Vy Capital funded Reddit in a recent round (i.e. it owns part of it). That gives it preferential treatment in case it wanted to take it public through an associated vehicle. Source: https://www.inc.com/christine-lagorio/reddit-300-millon-dollar-funding-round-tencent.html 6- Vy Global Growth indicated it is not prohibited from acquiring a stake in a company affiliated with Vy Capital. From the prospectus: ""We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination or subsequent transaction with a company that is affiliated with Vy Capital."" Why would they include such a clause? Probably intend to exercise their right as per this clause? As you can see, loads of datapoints supporting the possibility that VYGG is likely to end up merging with Reddit. As I write this, VYGG shares are at $11, indicating a maximum possible loss of $1 (since VYGG is currently nothing but a pile of cash with $10 of cash per share). This is how the most risk averse person should think of the downside here, though the actual downside is probably $0.5 per share based on how its been trading since it IPO'd. The upside? If we get lucky and it does end up taking Reddit public? Easily $20 on day 1, and higher afterwards üöÄüöÄüöÄ. This (along with several other SPACs I currently own) offer some of the best risk-reward setups I've ever seen in my life. Let me know what you guys think.",Neutral,Positive

Total other consumer products revenue in Q1 2022 increased 39% year-over year to $43 million Net Earnings in Q1 2022 of $390 million, which is a $518 million improvement versus Q1 2021 Adjusted EBITDA loss in Q1 2022 was $64 million, a $29 million narrower loss versus Q1 2021 driven by higher sales and lower operating expenses. Canadian recreational sales grew 35% year-over-year, even as the industry was impacted by COVID lockdowns for much of the quarter. Canopy Growth maintained #1 market share in tracked provinces, with total market share (including Ace Valley and Supreme) of 15.2% during Q1 2022. In total Flower category, Canopy Growth also maintained #1 market share with 17.9% in Q1 2022.

"I lost 20k today due to their platform not accepting sells, limits, stop losses, staying cancelling in a loop. I placed a stop loss at above break even then decided to modify it under it was stuck like this. Then the position went way down . And couldn't sell or do anything . Then I put a limit sell down. It didn't went through or couldn't sell or anything. I was stuck with the shares. They went up after and closed green, still couldn't sell or do anything and my market order was stuck doing nothing (stock was very high volume). The after market closed, at 21:04(it even says in their app it executed at that time) It shows my position sold at the limit loss put half an hour ago. I WAS STUCK with money due to their bugged platform. I have screenshots of everything . THIS IS FUCKERY WITH US AND WE CANT LET THEM FUCK LIKE THIS Not related to GME or stuff like that I have seen many others had the same problem today and fucked them Edit: I had a useless stop loss at 1.9 when the stock was over 2 and it dumped under 1.9 , stop loss didn't trigger , couldn't modify ,couldn't place another one due to ""not having the securities "" as they are stock in their limbo system when you place limit sells and stop losses and not let you place other ones until old ones are cleared. They weren't clears thus I lost a lot due to this. Stock was NYSE and had over 100m volume , so it wasn't liquidity. Is their platform being bugged and it costed me an extra 15k in losses because my first stop loss was stuck and couldn't modify it or re open it. I emailed them a complaint requested my money back to the amount which I bought the shares. I am willing to go middle way with them accepting the difference I lost due to my first stop loss not working caused by bugged platform. You can't fuck people's money due to your system being fucked and not have repercussions. What if your broker fucked you for 200k due to their platform being fucked. It doesn't matter if is 2$ or 20k , is your money and they shouldn't let shit like this happens with you compensating for it.

"Hi WSB, I've seen a lot of people talking about gamma squeezes recently, but I haven't seen anyone explain the math correctly. In fact, even the recent [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2021/03/05/gamestopgamestonk-has-nothing-to-do-with-the-madness-of-crowds/) got the concept wrong. So I figured I'd sit down this fine Saturday morning and put together a post on the actual mathematics of a gamma squeeze. I'll talk about options concepts such as the Greeks, but I won't go into so much detail that you'd need to understand the [Black-Scholes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model) equation or anything. &#x200B; **Market makers** The first thing you need to understand is who is on the other side of your trade when you buy a call option. Typically, this is *not* some other trader or hedge fund that wants to inverse your bet. Instead, the counter-party is what we call a [market maker](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp). Market makers profit from providing liquidity to markets, *not* from taking directional positions. In practice, what this means is that market makers charge you a slight premium, and then position themselves so that no matter what happens, their premium is preserved. This positioning is called hedging. &#x200B; **How market makers hedge call options** There are infinite ways that market makers could theoretically hedge against the calls they sell. However, by far the simplest and most prevalent way is to buy some amount of shares of the underlying stock. Remember that 1 options contract = 100 actual options. ***However, here's the part I think a lot of you are misunderstanding: market makers do not buy 100 shares of the underlying for every option contract they sell you. This would not be a hedged position! This would be equivalent to the market maker having a covered call on the stock, which is a bullish/neutral strategy, and will lose money if the underlying declines!*** The last thing a market maker would ever want to do is take a bullish position on the meme stocks that they are selling you options on. So how do market makers actually hedge? To understand how market makers *actually* hedge, first you need to understand two options concepts, delta and gamma. **Delta** The *delta* of an option represents how much the option would increase if the underlying increased by $1. So a delta of 0.3 means that for every $1 the underlying stock moves up, the option will go up by 30 cents. Remember that the initial price of the call option is much less than the stock, so that 30 cent increase is a much higher % increase than the corresponding increase in the stock. As an example, you may have paid $10 for a call option with a $100 strike on a stock that is currently trading for $50. If the delta on this option is 0.5, then if the stock moves to $51 dollars, the option will be worth \~$10.50. So, the stock moves up 2%, and the option moves up 5%. A key thing to know about delta is that it is not constant. It varies based on the changes in price of the underlying stock. In fact, as you can see in the chart below, delta is lowest for deep out-of-the-money calls, and highest for deep in-the-money calls. &#x200B; [Delta as a function of strike price \(the strike here is $300\)](https://preview.redd.it/fds5k58a6gl61.png?width=242&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5e2d94357b54a0057aadc2e890ee1dccf26924c) Without going into too much technical detail as to why, just note that this makes intuitive sense. If a stock is worth $100 and you have an option to buy it for a strike of $1 (deep deep deep in-the-money), then that option should be worth \~$99 and basically move exactly in tandem with the stock (i.e., have a delta \~1). Whereas, if you have an option you paid $1 for, which gives you the right to buy that same stock for a strike of $1,000, delta has to be very low. Otherwise (say delta was 1), every small 1% change in the stock would cause your option's price to double. **Gamma** *Gamma* is closely related to delta. Gamma represents how much the delta changes as the underlying stock moves up or down. So, in the chart above, gamma is the slope of the curve (In fact, if you know calculus, the simplest explanation of delta and gamma is that delta is the first derivative of the option price with respect to the price of the underlying stock, and gamma is the second derivative). While delta is highest when calls are deep in-the-money, gamma is actually highest when calls are exactly at-the-money. You can see this by noticing that the slope of the curve in the graph above is steepest at exactly the strike price ($300). This slope is gamma. The graph below shows this even more clearly. The red line is delta, and the blue line is gamma. &#x200B; [Plots of delta and gamma for a call option with a $25 strike price](https://preview.redd.it/bbvos2md8gl61.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=b21bdf2bd9d662d2347e84175b69c211c23ee785) **Delta-neutral strategies** Ok, now we're ready to understand how market makers hedge. Market makers employ [delta-neutral](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deltaneutral.asp) strategies. This means that their overall position will have a delta of zero with respect to the stock price (a stock always has a delta of 1 with respect to itself of course). So how do they do this? They do this by selling you a call option, and then buying just enough shares to maintain a delta-neutral position. They then constantly adjust their position, buying or selling more shares as the delta of the option increases or decreases. They can do this because they are large institutions who can trade quickly with little cost. The best way to understand this is with an example: $GME is currently trading at \~$137. You buy the Mar 19 2021 $150 call option, which is currently trading for $26.73 and has these greeks: &#x200B; [GME Mar 19 2021 $150c](https://preview.redd.it/3p5vr652agl61.png?width=696&format=png&auto=webp&s=6eefca1ecde4ae4c76f5d4c870212b5b48c3402e) A market maker takes the other side of this trade. When they sell you the option, they now have a delta of -0.498 for each option, and since options contracts trade in groups of 100, their overall delta is -49.8. Let's call is -50 for simplicity. In order to be delta-neutral, they need to balance this position with securities that have a delta of 50 with respect to GME. The simplest way to do this is buy shares. Each share of GME has a delta of 1 with respect to GME. So the market maker buys 50 shares of GME. Now their overall position is this: *Position = 50 x (GME shares) - 1 x (GME Mar 19 $150c options contract)* and their overall delta is *-50 + 50 = 0* There are two important things to note about this: (1) The market maker wasn't forced to buy 100 shares of GME, like I've seen many users on here claim. Instead, they will only buy 50 shares. (2) Your trade cost you *$26.73 x 100 = $2,673,* and caused the market maker to buy *$137 \* 50 = $6,850* worth of GME shares. This is approximately 2.5x leverage. **Market maker repositioning** Remember that, as the stock price moves up or down, the delta of the option that the market maker sold you changes. The market maker wants to maintain a delta-neutral position, so they will rebalance their position by buying or selling shares. Let's continue with the example above, and assume that GME has gone up $2 and now trades at $139. According to the greeks in the table above, the new delta of the option will be approximately *0.498 + 2 x 0.0077 = 0.5134.* Remember that there are 100 options in a contract, so the delta of the contract is now *51.34*. If the market maker maintains their initial position of 50 GME shares, they will end up with a delta of *-1.34* with respect to GME. To avoid this, they need to purchase 1.34 shares of GME. Market makers will thus constantly adjust the number of shares they are holding in order to maintain delta-neutral positions. They incur some cost doing this, because the more volatile the stock is, the less quickly and efficiently the market makers can hedge. But they still make money overall, because they've charged you a premium for the option that takes this into account. This is why they charge you a higher premium for volatile stocks. **Gamma squeezes** Now we are finally in a position to discuss gamma squeezes. Now that you understand how market makers hedge, the rest is very simple. As the underlying stock goes up, market makers that have sold you call options will buy more stock in order to maintain a delta-neutral position. The amount of stock they have to buy is proportional to how much the delta of the options changes, which is just gamma. And gamma is at its highest when options contracts are at-the-money. And so, when there are a ton of call options on a stock, price increases in the stock cause market makers to buy even more of the stock, and the rate of buying is highest when the option contract is at-the-money. *This is the gamma squeeze.* Notice that the inverse is also true; when the stock price decreases, the delta of the options decreases, and market makers sell stock in order to maintain delta-neutrality. **Epilogue: a note on leverage** Now you understand gamma squeezes and how market makers hedge. You can actually use this information to determine exactly how much share buying you are causing when you buy a call option. Using this and the option price, we can actually calculate how much purchasing leverage you have when buying an option. The formula is this: *Purchasing leverage = (delta \* (stock price)) / (options price)* For example: &#x200B; *Options contract 1: Deep in-the-money* *March 19 2021 40c: $101 price, 1.0 delta* *Purchasing leverage = (1 \* 137) / 101 = 1.36* &#x200B; *Options contract 2: Deep out-of-the-money* *March 19 2021 300c: $8.15 price, 0.0283 delta* *Purchasing leverage = (0.0283 \* 137) / 8.15 = 0.475* &#x200B; As you can see, some deep deep out-of-the-money options are currently selling at such a high price that some of them actually have purchasing leverage of less than 1x. This is really unusual, but shows how volatile GME is. However, options that are closer to the strike price but still out-of-the-money still have high leverage, like the $150 March 19th options with 2.5x leverage. I haven't calculated which options have the highest purchasing power leverage since that's a lot of number crunching for a Saturday morning (but maybe someone in the comments can?) Anyway, do with this information what you will WSB. Godspeed *\*Disclosure: this is not investment advice. Also, hell fucking yeah I've got call options on GME.\**",Positive,Negative

"We all know that‚Äôs bullshit. But WHY do we know that‚Äôs bullshit? Well, if you‚Äôre new to investing there‚Äôs a concept called margin. Margin is essentially a line of credit given by brokerages to users to trade with. They still ‚Äúown‚Äù whatever you buy with it, but you‚Äôre allowed to take profits on how you use it, paying them back with interest once you‚Äôve made gains. If you‚Äôre not making gains, they‚Äôll sell your stuff for you and you‚Äôll be responsible for making up the loss. A while back, people in financial circles were freaking out because of the ‚Äúinflux of you inexperienced investors trading on margin‚Äù, thinking it could cause a crash from reckless investing. Of course that‚Äôs not true, because the retail investor is on the hook for these losses. What might bring down the market is institutional investors utilizing some of the strategies that they said uninformed retail investors would do. It‚Äôs hypocrisy incarnate. You‚Äôre on the hook for your margin losses, or any cash losses. They‚Äôre trying to get hedge funds OFF the hook for theirs. Here‚Äôs the thing though. Almost ANYONE could get an ABSOLUTE SHITLOAD OF MARGIN. Unemployed college students and $40k/year average people were given thousands, often tens of thousands, dollars of credit to trade with. These are essentially loans that they know very few people will actually benefit from. Loans your bank would never give you. RH didn‚Äôt give a shit, because they don‚Äôt give a shit about your risk. Once people realized buying GME with their own cash was a sure fire way to make money, they started ‚Äúcaring about your risk‚Äù. They‚Äôre not limiting your risk. They‚Äôre limiting your GAINS that you‚Äôd earn at the expense of hedge funds that pay them for your trading data. ‚ÄúRisk with a high likelihood of downside? Have at it. Risk with almost surefire insanely high upside? We‚Äôre gonna have to step in. ‚Äú Edit to add: yes, there‚Äôs also the (probably more impactful) reality that they likely didn‚Äôt have the capital they needed to facilitate these trades.

"Here is some DD on HYPRO. I hope to hear your thoughts on this, in my opinion, very bullish company. 1. HYPRO specialises in large-scale hydrogen production (100MW). They are in the midst of demonstrating their new patented technology which takes the efficiency of hydrogen production up to 94% compared to the rest of the hydrogen industry that is lagging behind at 80%. This technology is expected to be ready for the markets in 2022. They will have the best technology in the hydrogen sector. Massive. The EU is funding companies that are able to demonstrate efficient hydrogen production in the scale of 100MW production plants. HYPRO has applied for this funding and decisions concerning the funding will come this June. HYPROs technology will take the dollar price of producing a kilogram of hydrogen to 1,2dollars compared to EUs goal of finding someone who can produce it for 2,5‚Ç¨/kg of hydrogen. Almost hard to believe.. 2. In Q4 of 2020 HYPRO made an operating profit, which is pretty unheard of in the hydrogen industry. Everyone else is taking losses. 3. HYPRO has no debt. 4. HYPRO just signed a deal with Hynion about supplying hydrogen to 30 hydrogen fueling stations that will be built in Scandinavia in the coming years. Hundreds of trucks delivering goods will be charged in these stations. HYPRO and Hynion in collaboration are the only ones providing hydrogen fueling stations in the near future and will have an advantage on everyone else. 5. HYPRO is in a huge dip and hasn¬¥t soared 1000% like some other companies like PLUG. 6. They are helping energy giant Repsol to achieve carbon-neutrality by 2050. They are working on a 100MW hydrogen plant in Spain and many more projects may follow. 3 other plants are being constructed, 2 of which are in the US and 1 in France. &#x200B; Here is their most recent report on their website where most of my claims are from: [https://hydrogen-pro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HydrogenPro-Q4-2020-Report-and-Company-update-22FEB21.pdf](https://hydrogen-pro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HydrogenPro-Q4-2020-Report-and-Company-update-22FEB21.pdf) Positions: 1049 shares with an average of 46,76NOK Do your now research and let me know what you think! It's still a small company but to me that means a lot of growth potential. Weather you think hydrogen is the future or not, the EU has lots of plans in the hydrogen sector and the price of it is coming down fast. Up to 6GWs of hydrogen plants are to be built by 2024. HYPRO could take a good portion of that. The steel industry will also want to get rid of emissions when the price of pollution becomes greater than the price of switching to hydrogen.",Neutral,Positive

"So, I went digging through LEAPs for GME, cause I am retarded. &#x200B; I noticed the premium for selling a call way out, say January 2023, is 320.5, on the $2 strike So now, shares of GME are 312. So in theory, if I took my $31,200 and bought 100 shares, and sold the $2 call, even if I just met the ask, I get 320 premium. So my 31200 becomes 32000, and eventually 32200 after the call expires and I get an extra 200. But essentially I turned 31200 into 32000 with no effort. So 800 per contract sold. Obviously volume is low, but say I could do this 200x (which according to asks, it's 320.5), that's 850 profit per contract (32,050-31200). So now I can take my 32050 and do the same, and eventually, after 36th one sold, I can then start selling 2, etc. And after my 200th, which takes up all the volume for the ones that profit an average of 850, I have an extra $170,000. Obviously this cannot be correct. What am I missing? &#x200B; TLDR: &#x200B; Buy a stock for 31200, sell a covered call and get 32050. That's a profit of 850. Rinse and repeat until you have sold to all the asks over the share price, 200x. Not only are 20,000 shares locked up for a bit in long term options, but you have gained 850 profit 200x, which is 170k. &#x200B; WHAT AM I MISSING? Where does this go south? &#x200B; Edit: The answer is I forgot to account for the fact GME closed at 324, and the bid is 320. So you would lose 400 per trade. Now if it followed the meeting in the middle of the Bid ask spread then it would be a 150 profit per trade, but only 76 of those exist. Thanks u/boblawslawblawg &#x200B; Edit 2: corrected username.

"After CLOV, SOFI, AND SPCE- all recovered from the last months dips in growth, only Opendoor hasn't yet recovered and is still consolidating around 17$ after it was 39$ earlier this year with intention to go much higher. IMO, Opendoor is BY FAR the best company out of any Chamath‚Äô stocks and after slowing down during COVID, they proved in their last earning report that they are back to be a super-high growth company with over 1.5B$ in cash and a huge capitalization over the real-estate market .OPEN is only valued now at about 10B$ with earnings of about 4B$ expected this year, super low valuation of barely X2.5 Price-to-sales. They dominate the iBuying market over Zillow and Redfin- Image attached, and will surely be a multi-bagger in the upcoming years. My PT is 50$ within the next 6-12 months and 100$ within 2 years. https://preview.redd.it/ta3clto48o471.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=76807e93805e8e4dbae5cfb2d25fdc2b59dcb1fd",Positive,Positive
"As many of you are aware, /r/wallstreetbets has undergone some changes on the mod list over the last couple of days. According to reddit, the top mods of the community were removed for violating rule 5 of the moderator guidelines, which is: ""healthy communities have moderators who are around to answer questions of their community and engage with the admins."" The attempt of the top mods to remove all of us and censor you failed, thanks to the actions of the reddit admins. We are grateful to everyone in the community who stood up for us. Unfortunately, /u/zjz will also not be allowed to come back to moderate the subreddit. This is a decision made by reddit, not us, due to the instability that was created by his last post on the subreddit. We know the respect that you all have for him, each one of us mods has that respect for him too. The hard work and time that /u/zjz put into the subreddit cannot be replaced, but we will try our best to keep the subreddit up to his lofty standards and our high expectations. Moving forward, we are working harder than ever and we need your help. Since /u/zjz ran all of our bots and was also the most active mod, there is a massive void left by his absence. If anyone has the desire to code a new bot for us and/or the time to moderate, as well as the experience on WSB (at least one year), we would appreciate your help. Do not harass any former moderators. We need to move on from this and put it behind us all. This is the best community on reddit, let's keep it that way.

"**DISCLOSURE: I'm currently short PEN for 600$ through CFDs** Disclaimer: this is not financial advice, I just HATE the company As you can see from my post history, I've been following this trade since Gabriel Fucking Grego, aka fraudolent company slayer, posted his short thesis on the stock. Yes the stock IS overvalued, but what isn't at the current market level? So let's look at another thing: LAWSUITS. This is a list of lawsuits that come up just in the first page of Google results, and many more to come since I get alerts everyday.
